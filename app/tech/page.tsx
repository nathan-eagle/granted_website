            <p><strong>Data.</strong> Granted has the world&apos;s largest database of 615,000 successful grant proposals vectorized using OpenAI&apos;s embedding protocol. (Data from our users remains private and never becomes training data.)</p>
            <p><strong>Algorithms.</strong> The Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) identifies similar successful grants from the public grant database.</p>
            <p><strong>Tools.</strong> In parallel, LangChain is used to build out the applicant&apos;s biography via web summarization while learning what the prospective funding agency is looking for.</p>
            <p><strong>Models.</strong> A suite of large language models, including GPT‑4, are provided with all of this context along with proprietary prompts to generate a first draft of the proposal.</p>
            <p><strong>Evaluators.</strong> Granted&apos;s AI proposal evaluators reflect on this first draft and identify reasons why it should not be funded. This feedback is incorporated into a second draft and then sent back out to the panel of AI evaluators. Through recurrent loops of reflection and evaluation, Granted converges on the winning proposal in minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Agents.</strong> Meanwhile, AutoGPT is always on the lookout for new grant announcements and requests for proposals that fit the applicant&apos;s profile.</p>

              Granted&apos;s AI is a highly specialized version of a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) with model weights finetuned by leading fundraising experts. After modifying the parameter weights, these experts designed hundreds of writing models for this purpose-built AI to target specific grants and funding agencies.
