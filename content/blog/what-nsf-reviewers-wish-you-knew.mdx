## Unlocking the Secrets of Successful Grant Proposals: What NSF Reviewers Wish You Knew

### Introduction

 As a grant proposal writer, you know that securing funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) can be a game-changer for your organization. However, with thousands of applications submitted each year, it's crucial to understand what NSF reviewers are looking for in a winning proposal. In this blog post, we'll reveal the insider tips, best practices, and actionable advice that NSF reviewers wish you knew. By the end of this post, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and strategies to elevate your grant writing skills and increase your chances of success.

### 1. Understand the Review Criteria

 The first step in crafting a successful NSF grant proposal is to familiarize yourself with the two primary review criteria: *Intellectual Merit* and *Broader Impacts*. These criteria are the foundation of the NSF's decision-making process, and your proposal should address both in a clear and compelling manner.
 
 **Intellectual Merit** refers to the potential of your project to advance knowledge within its field. To demonstrate this, your proposal should:

- Present a well-formulated research question or problem
 - Explain the significance and novelty of your project
 - Outline a clear and feasible methodology
 - Highlight your team's expertise and qualifications
 
**Broader Impacts** encompass the potential benefits of your project to society and the scientific community. To showcase these impacts, your proposal should:

- Identify specific target audiences or stakeholders
 - Describe the expected outcomes and benefits
 - Outline plans for dissemination and outreach
 - Address any ethical, social, or environmental considerations

### 2. Tell a Compelling Story

 NSF reviewers read countless proposals, so it's essential to make yours stand out by telling a captivating story. Start with a strong opening that grabs the reader's attention and sets the stage for your project. Throughout your proposal, use clear and concise language, avoid jargon, and focus on the most important and relevant information.
 
 Incorporate real-life examples and analogies to illustrate your points and make your proposal more relatable. For instance, if your project aims to develop a new water filtration technology, you could share a story about a community that struggles with access to clean water and how your innovation could improve their lives.

### 3. Establish Measurable Objectives and Outcomes

 NSF reviewers want to see that your project has well-defined, achievable goals and that you have a plan to measure your progress. Be specific about your objectives and the expected outcomes, and include a timeline for achieving them. Use quantifiable metrics and indicators to demonstrate the potential impact of your project, and explain how you will collect and analyze data to assess your progress.

### 4. Communicate Effectively with Funders

 Building a strong relationship with your NSF program officer is crucial for the success of your proposal. Reach out to them early in the process to discuss your project idea, ask for guidance, and clarify any questions you may have about the application process. Maintain open lines of communication throughout the proposal development and submission process, and be responsive to any feedback or requests for additional information.

### 5. Learn from Successful Grant Applications

 One of the best ways to improve your grant writing skills is to study successful NSF grant proposals. Analyze their structure, language, and presentation of information to identify the elements that make them stand out. Pay close attention to how they address the review criteria, tell a compelling story, and establish measurable objectives and outcomes.

### Conclusion

 By understanding the NSF review criteria, telling a compelling story, establishing measurable objectives and outcomes, and effectively communicating with funders, you can significantly increase your chances of securing NSF funding. Remember to continuously refine your grant writing skills by learning from successful proposals and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in the field. With dedication and persistence, you can become a grant writing expert and help your organization achieve its goals.
