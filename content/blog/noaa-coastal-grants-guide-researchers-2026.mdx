The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remains one of the most consequential funders of ocean and coastal science in the United States. For researchers working at the intersection of marine ecology, coastal hazards, climate adaptation, and community resilience, NOAA grants represent a critical funding pathway that supports both foundational research and applied work with direct societal impact.

What distinguishes NOAA funding from other federal science agencies is its mandate to connect research to operational outcomes. NOAA does not fund curiosity-driven science in isolation. Every dollar the agency awards is tied to its mission of understanding and predicting changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts, and then translating that understanding into actionable information for communities, industries, and decision-makers. If your research agenda aligns with that translation from knowledge to action, NOAA is where you should be looking.

This guide walks through the major [NOAA grant programs](/grants/noaa), what the agency is prioritizing in 2026, and how to position your proposal for success.

## Key NOAA Grant Programs for Researchers

NOAA distributes funding through a constellation of programs, each with distinct scopes, eligibility criteria, and application timelines. Understanding which program fits your work is the first step toward a competitive submission.

### Sea Grant

The National Sea Grant College Program is NOAA's primary vehicle for supporting university-based coastal and marine research. With 34 programs distributed across every coastal and Great Lakes state, Sea Grant funds research, extension, and education activities that address regional priorities while contributing to national goals.

Sea Grant operates on a biennial competition cycle. Each state program issues its own request for proposals, typically aligned with a strategic plan that reflects local needs. Annual funding across the network exceeds $90 million, with individual project awards ranging from $50,000 to $300,000 depending on the state program and funding cycle. Matching funds are required, usually at a 1:1 ratio of federal to non-federal support.

For early-career researchers, Sea Grant is often the most accessible entry point into the NOAA funding ecosystem. The state programs maintain close relationships with their university partners and can provide pre-submission guidance that larger federal competitions cannot match. If you have not connected with your regional Sea Grant program, that should be your first call.

### Marine Debris Program

NOAA's Marine Debris Program funds research, prevention, and removal activities focused on the growing problem of debris in the marine environment. The program has expanded significantly over the past several funding cycles, driven in part by Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocations and growing public concern over ocean plastics.

Active funding streams include marine debris removal grants, which support on-the-ground cleanup of derelict fishing gear, abandoned vessels, and other large debris in coastal waters. Research grants support work on debris sources, transport, fate, and ecological impacts. Prevention grants fund community-based projects that reduce debris inputs at the source. For a detailed walkthrough of the removal grants specifically, see our [guide to NOAA marine debris removal grants](/blog/noaa-marine-debris-removal-grants-how-to-apply).

Awards in this program typically range from $100,000 to $5 million depending on the specific opportunity, with larger awards reserved for multi-year removal projects involving significant field operations.

### Coastal Resilience Grants

NOAA's coastal resilience portfolio includes several programs aimed at helping communities prepare for and adapt to coastal hazards. The Transformational Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience Grants represent the flagship program, with awards of up to $10 million for large-scale projects that restore coastal habitat while delivering measurable resilience benefits. Our [coastal resilience grants 2026 funding guide](/blog/coastal-resilience-grants-2026-funding-guide) covers these programs in depth.

Smaller-scale resilience work is funded through the National Coastal Resilience Fund, a partnership between NOAA and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Regional coastal resilience grants are also available through individual Sea Grant programs and NOAA's Office for Coastal Management.

### Climate Adaptation Science

NOAA funds climate adaptation research through multiple offices, including the Climate Program Office, the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. These programs support work on climate projections, vulnerability assessments, adaptation planning tools, and decision-support frameworks.

The Climate Adaptation Partnerships program, formerly known as RISA (Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments), supports interdisciplinary research teams that work directly with communities and resource managers to build adaptive capacity. These awards are substantial, typically $1 million to $2 million over five years, and emphasize co-production of knowledge with end users.

## NOAA Funding Priorities for 2026

NOAA's budget and strategic direction for 2026 reflect several clear priorities that researchers should factor into their proposal development.

Climate-ready communities remain at the top of the list. NOAA is investing heavily in research and tools that help coastal communities understand their exposure to sea level rise, storm surge, compound flooding, and heat. Proposals that connect observational science or modeling to community-level decision-making will find a receptive audience.

The blue economy is another area of growing emphasis. NOAA is increasingly interested in research that supports sustainable ocean industries, including aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, marine transportation, and coastal tourism. If your work has implications for economic activity in the marine environment, frame those connections explicitly.

Environmental DNA and emerging biological monitoring technologies have moved from the periphery to the mainstream of NOAA-funded science. The agency is funding eDNA work through multiple programs, particularly in fisheries stock assessment, habitat characterization, and biodiversity monitoring. This represents a significant new funding avenue for molecular ecologists and bioinformaticians.

Equity and environmental justice continue to shape NOAA's funding criteria. Multiple programs now include evaluation criteria related to underserved communities, and several set aside funding specifically for tribal nations and organizations serving disadvantaged populations. This is not a checkbox exercise. Proposals that demonstrate authentic engagement with affected communities will score meaningfully higher.

## Eligibility: Who Can Apply

NOAA grants are open to a broad range of applicants, though specific eligibility varies by program.

**Universities and research institutions** are eligible for nearly all NOAA research funding. This includes public and private institutions of higher education, with or without Sea Grant affiliation. Having a relationship with your state's Sea Grant program is not strictly required for most NOAA competitions, but it provides a significant practical advantage.

**Nonprofit organizations** are eligible for most NOAA programs, particularly those focused on community resilience, debris removal, and education. Nonprofits applying for research-heavy grants should demonstrate that they have the scientific capacity, either in-house or through institutional partnerships, to carry out the proposed work.

**State and local government agencies** are primary applicants for many coastal management and resilience programs. Some programs, such as the National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grants, are restricted exclusively to state agencies.

**Tribal organizations** receive priority consideration across multiple NOAA programs. Several competitions reserve a percentage of available funds for federally recognized tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, and organizations representing tribal interests. The Indian Environmental General Assistance Program and tribal set-asides within larger competitions provide dedicated pathways for tribal applicants.

**For-profit entities** are eligible for some NOAA programs, particularly those with technology development or applied research components. However, the majority of NOAA's competitive grant funding targets the nonprofit and academic sectors.

All applicants must maintain active registration in SAM.gov and, for most opportunities, submit through Grants.gov. For [grants for researchers](/grants/researchers) at academic institutions, your sponsored research office should handle institutional registration, but verify that your SAM.gov status is current well before any deadline.

## How to Find NOAA Funding Opportunities

NOAA posts its funding opportunities across multiple platforms, which can make tracking them a challenge for researchers who are not dedicated grant professionals.

Grants.gov is the official portal for most NOAA competitive funding. Search using CFDA numbers specific to NOAA programs (the agency code is DOC-NOAA) or filter by the Department of Commerce. The NOAA Grants Management Division also maintains its own listing page with upcoming and open competitions.

Each Sea Grant state program posts its own funding opportunities independently, so you need to check your regional program's website for locally administered competitions.

Our [grant finder](/grants) tool aggregates federal funding opportunities across agencies, including NOAA, and allows you to filter by research area, applicant type, and deadline. This can save significant time compared to monitoring multiple agency websites independently. You can also [browse all grants](/grants) to explore opportunities across the full federal funding landscape.

For researchers interested in environmental funding more broadly, [EPA grants](/grants/epa) represent a complementary source of support, particularly for work at the land-sea interface, water quality, and environmental justice.

## The NOAA Proposal Process: What Makes It Unique

NOAA's proposal process has several distinctive characteristics that set it apart from NSF, NIH, or other major federal funders.

First, NOAA competitions are typically announced through Notices of Funding Opportunity published on Grants.gov, with application windows that can be as short as 60 days. Unlike NSF, which has standing programs with predictable annual deadlines, NOAA funding opportunities can appear on an irregular schedule. Staying connected to your NOAA program officer and relevant Sea Grant network helps you anticipate upcoming competitions before they are formally announced.

Second, NOAA proposals are evaluated by panels that include both scientists and practitioners. This means your proposal needs to be technically rigorous and operationally credible. Reviewers will scrutinize whether your proposed work can actually be implemented as described, whether your timeline is realistic, and whether your outputs will be usable by the intended audience.

Third, NOAA places significant weight on partnerships and letters of collaboration. A well-constructed partnership network is not an accessory to your proposal. It is a core evaluation criterion. More on this below.

Fourth, many NOAA programs require or strongly encourage pre-application consultation. Taking advantage of informational webinars, contacting program officers with questions, and submitting optional letters of intent are not just permitted, they are expected parts of the process.

## Writing a Competitive NOAA Proposal

The fundamentals of strong grant writing apply to NOAA proposals just as they do everywhere else. If you need a refresher on the basics, our guide on [how to write a grant proposal](/blog/how-to-write-a-grant-proposal) covers the essentials. What follows are the NOAA-specific considerations that can make the difference between a funded and unfunded application.

### Connect Research to NOAA's Mission

Every section of your proposal should make clear how your work advances NOAA's operational mission. If you are studying coral reef ecology, explain how your findings will inform NOAA's coral reef conservation strategy. If you are developing a new storm surge model, describe how it integrates with NOAA's existing forecasting infrastructure. Reviewers want to see that you understand the agency's priorities and have designed your project to serve them.

### Demonstrate Stakeholder Engagement

NOAA proposals that describe research conducted in partnership with resource managers, community leaders, or industry stakeholders consistently outperform those that propose to deliver findings to end users after the fact. The agency favors co-production models where non-academic partners are involved in defining research questions, interpreting results, and applying findings.

Include letters of collaboration, not just support, that describe what each partner will contribute and how they will use project outputs. Generic letters that say nothing more than "we support this important work" add little value.

### Articulate Measurable Outcomes

NOAA increasingly requires applicants to define specific, measurable outcomes, not just outputs. The distinction matters. Publishing three papers is an output. Improving a coastal community's flood forecast accuracy by a quantified margin is an outcome. Developing a decision-support tool is an output. Demonstrating that 15 resource managers used that tool to inform management decisions is an outcome.

Your proposal should include a logic model or theory of change that traces the path from research activities to societal benefits. Be concrete about how you will measure success.

### Address Broader Context

NOAA reviewers appreciate proposals that situate the work within the broader scientific and policy landscape. Acknowledge related work, both NOAA-funded and otherwise. Explain how your project fills a gap, extends previous findings, or addresses a limitation that prior work could not resolve. Demonstrating awareness of the existing portfolio tells reviewers you have done your homework.

## Data Management and Sharing Requirements

NOAA has some of the most rigorous data management requirements of any federal funder, and they are getting stricter. Every proposal must include a Data Management Plan that describes how data will be collected, processed, quality-controlled, documented, and made publicly accessible.

NOAA expects data to be submitted to one of its National Centers for Environmental Information or another approved public repository within two years of collection, and often sooner. Metadata must conform to established standards, typically ISO 19115 or a NOAA-approved profile.

For researchers accustomed to NSF's data management requirements, NOAA's expectations are comparable but with more emphasis on specific data formats, quality assurance procedures, and archival timelines. If you have not previously navigated these requirements, our guide on [data management plans](/blog/data-management-plans-a-key-component-of-your-nsf-grant-application) provides a strong foundation, though you should review NOAA's specific policies for the program you are targeting.

Environmental data, geospatial information, and model outputs all have specific handling and sharing protocols within NOAA. Budget time and personnel for data management activities in your proposal. Reviewers will notice if data management appears to be an afterthought.

## Partnerships and Collaborative Proposals

Collaborative proposals are not just encouraged at NOAA. For many programs, they are effectively required. NOAA's evaluation criteria routinely assign significant weight to the quality and breadth of partnerships, and proposals from single investigators without institutional or community partners face a steep disadvantage.

Effective NOAA partnerships typically span multiple categories. Academic collaborators bring disciplinary expertise and student training capacity. Government partners at the state, local, or tribal level provide regulatory context, management authority, and on-the-ground implementation capacity. Nonprofit partners contribute community relationships, outreach infrastructure, and local knowledge. Industry partners can provide co-funding, technology, and pathways to commercial application.

The key is that each partner should have a defined role with specific deliverables. NOAA reviewers are experienced at distinguishing genuine collaboration from partnerships of convenience assembled in the final weeks before a deadline. Begin partnership development early in the proposal process, ideally months before the funding announcement drops.

Multi-institutional proposals should designate a lead institution with a principal investigator who has demonstrated project management capacity. NOAA will hold the lead institution accountable for the performance of all partners, so choose collaborators whose reliability you trust.

## Budget Considerations for NOAA Grants

NOAA budgets follow standard federal cost principles, but several program-specific considerations deserve attention.

**Cost sharing and matching funds.** Many NOAA programs require non-federal matching funds, typically ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent of the total project cost. Sea Grant programs require a 1:1 match. Matching can include in-kind contributions such as personnel time, equipment use, and facilities, but the contributions must be documented and verifiable. Securing match commitments from partners early in the proposal process avoids last-minute scrambling.

**Indirect cost rates.** NOAA generally honors negotiated indirect cost rates, but some programs cap indirect costs at a specific percentage, often 25 or 30 percent. Check the specific funding announcement for any indirect cost limitations. If your institution's negotiated rate is significantly higher than the program cap, you will need to absorb the difference or reduce your direct costs accordingly.

**Equipment and vessel time.** Research that involves fieldwork in the marine environment often requires specialized equipment and vessel time. NOAA reviewers expect realistic cost estimates grounded in current charter rates or institutional vessel operating costs. If you are proposing work that requires NOAA ship time, coordinate with the NOAA fleet well in advance, as ship scheduling operates on long lead times.

**Personnel and training.** NOAA values the training of the next generation of ocean and coastal scientists. Including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and Sea Grant fellows in your budget demonstrates investment in workforce development, which aligns with NOAA's strategic goals.

**Travel.** Budget for annual PI meetings and workshops that NOAA programs frequently convene. These gatherings serve as important coordination points across funded projects, and attendance is typically expected.

## Post-Award Management and Reporting

Receiving a NOAA award brings a set of reporting and compliance obligations that are more intensive than what many researchers experience with other funders.

NOAA requires semi-annual progress reports and financial status reports throughout the award period. These reports are submitted through NOAA's Grants Online system and are reviewed by both program officers and grants management specialists. Late or incomplete reports can result in funding holds on future increments.

Performance metrics are taken seriously. If your proposal committed to specific outcomes or milestones, NOAA will track your progress against those commitments. Be realistic in your proposal about what you can achieve, because you will be held to it.

Data submission obligations, as described above, extend beyond the award period. NOAA may follow up years after your grant closes to verify that data has been properly archived and made publicly accessible.

For multi-year awards, NOAA conducts annual reviews that can result in adjustments to scope, budget, or timeline. Maintaining open communication with your program officer is essential. If your project encounters obstacles, whether scientific, logistical, or administrative, report them early rather than waiting for the next scheduled report.

No-cost extensions are available when justified but are not automatic. Submit extension requests at least 90 days before the award end date, with a clear explanation of what work remains and why additional time is needed.

## Emerging Funding Areas

Several rapidly growing research domains are attracting increasing NOAA investment, creating opportunities for researchers who are positioned at these frontiers.

### Climate Resilience and Adaptation

NOAA's commitment to climate resilience funding has deepened significantly. The agency is moving beyond vulnerability assessment toward funding actionable adaptation strategies. Research that develops, tests, and evaluates adaptation interventions in real-world settings is in high demand. This includes nature-based solutions such as living shorelines and managed realignment, community relocation and managed retreat planning, infrastructure adaptation, and climate-informed resource management.

Proposals that engage directly with frontline communities, particularly those facing compounding climate risks, align strongly with NOAA's current direction.

### Blue Economy Research

The blue economy encompasses the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, and jobs while preserving the health of marine ecosystems. NOAA is funding research on sustainable aquaculture practices, offshore wind energy interactions with marine ecosystems, marine biotechnology, and ocean-based carbon dioxide removal.

This is an area where interdisciplinary proposals that bridge natural science, engineering, economics, and social science are particularly competitive. If your work touches the blue economy, even tangentially, frame those connections in your proposal.

### Environmental DNA and Emerging Technologies

Environmental DNA methods have matured rapidly, and NOAA is a leading funder of eDNA applications in fisheries science, invasive species monitoring, and biodiversity assessment. The agency is also investing in autonomous underwater vehicles, satellite-based ocean observation, machine learning for environmental prediction, and other technologies that promise to expand the scale and resolution of ocean monitoring.

Proposals that advance these methodologies while demonstrating clear applications to NOAA's operational needs are well positioned in the current funding climate.

### Environmental Justice in Coastal Communities

NOAA has elevated environmental justice from a peripheral concern to a central organizing principle across its grant portfolio. Research that examines disproportionate exposure of marginalized communities to coastal hazards, documents inequitable access to ocean resources, or develops inclusive decision-making frameworks for coastal management responds to a stated agency priority.

This intersects with broader federal environmental justice efforts. Researchers working in this space may also find relevant opportunities through [EPA grants](/grants/epa), which have a longer history of dedicated environmental justice funding.

## Positioning Your Research for NOAA Funding

The researchers who consistently win NOAA awards share a common trait: they understand that NOAA is a mission-driven agency, not an academic research council. Your proposal must demonstrate not only scientific rigor but operational relevance, stakeholder engagement, and a clear pathway from research findings to real-world impact.

Start by identifying which NOAA program aligns with your work. Connect with program officers and your regional Sea Grant network early. Build partnerships that strengthen both the science and the implementation potential of your project. Invest time in your data management plan and budget justification. And write your proposal for an audience that includes practitioners, not just disciplinary peers.

The funding landscape is competitive, but NOAA's investment in coastal and marine science continues to grow, particularly in climate adaptation, the blue economy, and emerging monitoring technologies. Researchers who align their work with these priorities and demonstrate the capacity to deliver actionable outcomes will find that NOAA remains one of the most rewarding and impactful sources of federal research funding available.
