Granted AI and Grantable are both platforms designed to help organizations write grant proposals, but they solve the problem from different angles. Granted AI is a purpose-built drafting platform that analyzes your specific solicitation and coaches you through every section. Grantable is a grant management and writing platform that combines proposal development with organizational tools like deadline tracking, document storage, and team coordination.

If you are trying to decide between them, the right choice depends on what your primary need is: drafting assistance for complex proposals or a broader platform that handles grant management alongside writing. This comparison covers the functional differences honestly, including where each tool excels and where each has limitations.

We build Granted AI, so our perspective is not neutral. But we have tested Grantable extensively, spoken with organizations that use it, and will be straightforward about its strengths.

## Core Philosophy: How Each Tool Approaches Grant Writing

### Granted AI: RFP-First Drafting

Granted AI is built around a single premise: the quality of a grant proposal depends on how well it responds to what the funder is asking for. The workflow starts with your solicitation document.

You upload the RFP, NOFO, BAA, or program announcement, and the platform analyzes it to extract:

- Required sections and their content expectations
- Evaluation criteria and scoring weights
- Formatting rules (page limits, font requirements, margin specifications)
- Eligibility conditions and compliance requirements
- Deadlines and submission logistics

From this analysis, Granted builds a structured workspace where each section of your proposal maps to specific funder requirements. Before drafting, the platform asks you targeted questions -- generated from the solicitation itself -- about your project, organization, methodology, and team. Your answers become the raw material for section-by-section drafting.

The output is a draft that directly addresses the funder's criteria, with a coverage tracker showing which requirements have been addressed, which are partially covered, and which are missing.

### Grantable: Management-Integrated Writing

Grantable takes a broader approach. It is a platform designed to manage the entire grant lifecycle, from identifying opportunities through post-award reporting. Writing assistance is one component of a larger system.

The platform includes:

- **Grant tracking and calendar management** for monitoring deadlines across multiple opportunities
- **Document repository** for storing organizational documents, past proposals, and supporting materials
- **Collaborative writing** with version control and team access
- **AI writing assistance** that generates proposal sections based on project information you provide
- **Template library** with structures for common grant types
- **Reporting tools** for tracking outcomes and generating funder reports

Grantable's writing assistant works from your organizational information and project details rather than from an analyzed solicitation document. You describe your project, and the AI generates proposal sections that follow standard proposal structures.

## Feature-by-Feature Breakdown

### RFP Analysis

**Granted AI:** The platform reads your complete solicitation document -- every page, every requirement, every scoring criterion. It identifies what the funder is asking for in each section, how the proposal will be scored, and what compliance requirements apply. This analysis structures the entire workspace.

**Grantable:** Does not analyze uploaded RFP documents to structure proposal drafting. The writing assistant generates content based on project information you input, using template structures for common grant types.

**Why this matters:** For straightforward foundation applications with predictable structures, RFP analysis is less critical. For complex federal solicitations -- a 60-page NIH NOFO, a DARPA BAA with multiple technical areas, an EPA NOFO with detailed scoring rubrics -- having the platform parse and organize the funder's requirements fundamentally changes the quality of the output.

### Drafting Methodology

**Granted AI:** Coached drafting. The platform asks you questions specific to each section before generating content. An NIH R01 Significance section produces different questions than a USDA REAP project narrative. Your answers are combined with the RFP requirements to generate each section individually, ensuring internal consistency.

**Grantable:** Template-based generation with AI enhancement. You provide organizational and project information through an intake process, and the platform generates sections following standard grant structures. The AI draws from your stored organizational data and the information you provide for each new proposal.

**Trade-off:** Granted's coached approach takes more time upfront but produces output more closely aligned to the specific solicitation. Grantable's approach is faster to start and benefits from stored organizational information across multiple proposals.

### Coverage and Compliance Tracking

**Granted AI:** The coverage panel is a central feature. It maps every requirement identified in the RFP against your draft, showing addressed, partially addressed, and unaddressed requirements in real time. For federal grants where missing a single criterion can cost your application points, this is a significant advantage.

**Grantable:** Does not provide RFP-specific coverage tracking, since it does not parse the solicitation document. However, the platform's project management features help you track tasks, deadlines, and document completion across your portfolio.

### Grant Management Features

**Granted AI:** Focused exclusively on the proposal writing phase. It does not include grant discovery, deadline calendars, document storage for non-proposal materials, or post-award management tools.

**Grantable:** This is Grantable's strength. The platform provides a comprehensive grant management system including opportunity tracking, deadline management, team collaboration, document storage, and reporting. For organizations managing 10+ active grants simultaneously, these operational tools provide real value that goes beyond any single proposal.

**Trade-off:** If your primary challenge is writing better proposals, Granted's focused approach gives you deeper writing assistance. If your primary challenge is organizational -- keeping track of multiple grants, deadlines, documents, and team members -- Grantable's broader platform addresses that need.

### Team Collaboration

**Granted AI:** Multiple team members can work within the same proposal workspace. The coaching questions and section drafts are shared, and the coverage tracker reflects the team's collective progress.

**Grantable:** Robust team collaboration features including role-based access, commenting, version tracking, and assignment of tasks to specific team members. For development teams with multiple writers working on different sections simultaneously, Grantable's collaboration tools are more developed.

### Output Quality

This is inherently subjective, but based on testing both platforms across multiple proposal types, here is a fair assessment.

**Granted AI output** tends to be more closely aligned with the specific language and requirements of the solicitation. Because the drafting engine has analyzed the RFP and been fed your answers to solicitation-specific questions, the resulting text addresses the funder's stated priorities directly. The coverage tracker also means you can identify and fill gaps before finalizing.

**Grantable output** is well-structured and follows conventional proposal formats effectively. For standard foundation and government grant applications, the templates produce clean, professional drafts. The output is less tailored to any specific solicitation's unique requirements but more consistent in style and structure across different proposals.

Both platforms produce drafts that require human editing. No AI tool produces submission-ready proposals, and you should expect to revise, add detail, and refine any AI-generated content.

### Document Export

**Granted AI:** Exports formatted proposals as Word documents.

**Grantable:** Exports as Word documents and PDFs, with formatting options.

Both handle export adequately for standard grant submissions.

## Pricing Comparison

### Granted AI

- **Starter Plan:** $29/month. Includes RFP analysis, coaching, and section drafting.
- **Professional Plan:** $89/month. Full access to all features with higher usage limits and priority support.
- **Free trial:** 7-day free trial on all plans.

For current pricing, see the [Granted AI pricing page](/pricing).

### Grantable

- **Individual plans** start at $49/month and include AI writing assistance, document management, and basic collaboration.
- **Team plans** are priced per user with additional collaboration and management features.
- **Enterprise pricing** is available for larger organizations.

Grantable's pricing reflects its broader feature set. If you are using the full management platform -- deadline tracking, document storage, team coordination, and reporting alongside writing -- the price-to-value ratio is reasonable. If you are primarily using the platform for writing assistance, the management features represent overhead you may not need.

Granted AI's pricing is lower at the entry level and focused entirely on writing. For organizations whose primary bottleneck is proposal quality rather than operational management, the focused investment makes more sense.

## Target Users: Who Each Tool Serves Best

### Granted AI Is Best For

**Researchers responding to federal solicitations.** If you are writing for NIH, NSF, DOD, DARPA, DOE, or other federal agencies with detailed NOFOs and specific scoring criteria, Granted's RFP analysis and coverage tracking provide structural advantages.

**Grant writers handling complex RFPs.** For solicitations longer than 10 pages with multiple required sections, specific evaluation criteria, and compliance requirements, the coached drafting approach ensures your proposal addresses every element.

**Consultants writing for multiple clients.** Grant consultants who need to produce high-quality, solicitation-specific proposals for different organizations benefit from a tool that adapts to each new RFP rather than relying on templates.

**Organizations where winning competitive proposals is the primary challenge.** If you are losing proposals not because of organizational management issues but because your writing does not score well against the criteria, Granted is designed to solve that specific problem.

### Grantable Is Best For

**Organizations managing multiple active grants.** If your development team is tracking 15 or 20 grants simultaneously across different funders, stages, and deadlines, Grantable's management features provide genuine operational value.

**Nonprofit teams that need collaboration infrastructure.** If your grant writing involves multiple people -- a program director providing content, a grant writer drafting, an executive director reviewing -- Grantable's role-based collaboration and version tracking support that workflow well.

**Organizations applying primarily to foundations.** Foundation applications tend to follow more standardized structures, and template-based drafting works well for these applications. Grantable's templates cover common foundation formats effectively.

**Development departments that need a single platform.** If you want one system for discovery, writing, management, and reporting rather than separate tools for each function, Grantable's integrated approach reduces tool sprawl.

## Honest Assessment: Strengths and Limitations

### Where Granted AI Is Stronger

**Solicitation-specific output.** The quality difference is most noticeable on complex federal proposals. When a 45-page NOFO has specific language about what each section must address, Granted's RFP analysis ensures those requirements are reflected in the draft.

**Compliance confidence.** The coverage tracker provides a verifiable check that your proposal addresses every scored criterion. For high-stakes federal submissions, this reduces the risk of missing a requirement that costs you points.

**Depth of drafting assistance.** The coaching questions extract more detailed, relevant information from you before drafting begins, resulting in output that reflects your actual project rather than generic template language.

### Where Grantable Is Stronger

**Organizational management.** If your bottleneck is tracking deadlines, managing documents, and coordinating a team across many grants, Grantable solves problems that Granted does not attempt to address.

**Portfolio view.** The ability to see all of your organization's grant activity -- pending, active, and completed -- in a single dashboard is valuable for directors who need to manage a development program, not just individual proposals.

**Institutional knowledge.** Grantable stores your organizational information and past proposals, creating a repository that makes future proposals easier. Over time, the platform becomes more useful as it accumulates your organization's data.

**Broader workflow support.** From opportunity identification through post-award reporting, Grantable covers more of the grant lifecycle than Granted AI, which focuses exclusively on proposal writing.

### Where Neither Tool Excels

**Grant discovery.** Neither Granted AI nor Grantable is primarily a grant discovery platform. Both integrate some discovery features, but dedicated tools like Grants.gov, Foundation Directory Online, and GrantStation remain the primary sources for finding funding opportunities.

**Post-award management.** While Grantable offers some post-award tracking, neither platform replaces a dedicated grants management system for complex compliance, financial reporting, and sub-award management.

## Making the Decision

Here is a framework for choosing between the two platforms.

**Choose Granted AI if:**

- Your primary challenge is writing proposals that score well against funder criteria
- You regularly respond to complex federal solicitations with specific requirements
- You want your drafting tool to analyze the actual RFP and structure your response around it
- You need compliance and coverage verification before submission
- Your organizational management needs are handled by other tools or processes

**Choose Grantable if:**

- You need a single platform for grant management and writing
- You manage a large portfolio of grants across multiple funders and stages
- Team collaboration on proposals is a primary requirement
- You apply mostly to foundations and standard government programs with predictable structures
- You want to build an organizational knowledge base that improves proposals over time

**Consider using both if:**

- You manage a large portfolio (use Grantable for tracking and management) and also submit complex federal proposals (use Granted for high-stakes drafting)
- Your development team has different needs for different types of applications

The best tool is the one that solves your most pressing problem. If you are losing proposals because they do not adequately address funder requirements, Granted AI targets that problem directly. If you are losing track of deadlines, documents, and team responsibilities across a large portfolio, Grantable targets that problem.

Both tools offer trial periods. The most reliable way to decide is to test each with a real project and evaluate the results against your specific needs.
