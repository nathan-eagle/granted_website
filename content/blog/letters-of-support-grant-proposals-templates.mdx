A strong grant proposal can fall apart without strong letters of support. Reviewers use these letters to gauge whether your project has genuine community backing, whether partners are truly committed, and whether your organization has the collaborative relationships needed to execute the proposed work. A generic letter adds nothing to your application. A specific, well-crafted letter can push a borderline proposal into the funded range.

This guide covers who to ask for letters of support, what each letter should contain, the critical difference between letters of support and letters of commitment, formatting and timing considerations, and four ready-to-use templates you can adapt for your next application.

## Letters of Support vs. Letters of Commitment

Before you request a single letter, you need to understand this distinction because funders take it seriously.

A **letter of support** expresses endorsement of your project. The signer is saying: "I believe in this work, and I support this organization's effort to carry it out." There is no binding obligation. The signer is not promising staff time, funding, facilities, or any other tangible resource. They are lending their credibility and institutional voice to your cause.

A **letter of commitment** goes further. The signer is pledging specific resources to the project -- staff time, matching funds, access to facilities, data sharing, referrals, or other measurable contributions. This pledge becomes part of your proposal narrative and may appear in your budget as cost-share or in-kind support.

Why does this matter? Because many federal NOFOs specify which type of letter they require. If the solicitation asks for letters of commitment from partners, a generic letter of support will not satisfy the requirement and may cost you points. If the NOFO asks for letters of support, including a letter of commitment is fine -- it exceeds the expectation -- but you need to be sure the signer understands and accepts the obligation.

Read your solicitation carefully. The NOFO will usually specify the type of letter required, who should write it, and sometimes the content it should include.

## Who to Ask for Letters

The right signers depend on the nature of your project and the expectations of the funder. Here is a framework for identifying the most valuable letter writers.

### Community Partners

If your project involves direct service delivery, community engagement, or collaborative programming, you need letters from the organizations you will work with. These include social service agencies, health clinics, schools, faith-based organizations, housing authorities, workforce development boards, and community-based organizations.

The most valuable community partner letters come from organizations that will play a defined role in your project. A letter from a community health center that will provide referrals and serve as a clinical site is far more persuasive than a letter from a health center that merely "supports" your work.

### Elected Officials and Government Leaders

Letters from mayors, city council members, county commissioners, state legislators, tribal leaders, and members of Congress carry weight because they signal political support and community-level buy-in. For federal grants to rural communities, a letter from the local USDA Rural Development office or a state agency can be particularly effective.

Elected officials receive many requests for support letters. Give them at least four weeks of lead time, and provide a concise project summary they can reference. Many offices prefer to draft the letter in-house based on your talking points. Others will sign a letter you draft, provided it accurately represents their position.

### University and Research Partners

If your project involves research, evaluation, or technical assistance from an academic institution, a letter from the partnering faculty member or department head is essential. For SBIR and STTR proposals, letters from university collaborators validate the technical approach and demonstrate access to specialized expertise.

University letters should specify: the faculty member's qualifications, the nature of the collaboration, the resources the university will contribute (lab space, equipment, graduate students), and any relevant prior work between the university and your organization.

### Industry and Private Sector Partners

For projects with commercialization, workforce development, or economic impact components, letters from industry partners demonstrate market relevance. SBIR Phase II proposals benefit enormously from letters of intent from potential customers. Nonprofit workforce programs gain credibility from employer partners who commit to hiring program graduates.

Industry letters should be specific about the business relationship. A letter from a manufacturing company that states it intends to purchase 500 units of your product upon successful development is orders of magnitude more valuable than a letter that says the company "looks forward to exploring future opportunities."

### Beneficiaries and Community Members

Some funders, particularly those focused on environmental justice, community development, and public health, value letters from the people who will directly benefit from the project. A letter from a community resident who describes the problem from lived experience and expresses support for the proposed solution adds a human dimension that data alone cannot provide.

These letters do not need to be formal or polished. Authenticity matters more than professional formatting.

## What Every Letter Should Include

Regardless of who is writing it, every letter of support should contain these elements:

1. **Date.** The letter should be dated within 60 days of the submission deadline. Older letters suggest the relationship may not be current.

2. **Addressed to the funder.** The salutation should name the specific agency, program, or foundation. "Dear Grants Review Committee" or "Dear [Program Officer Name]" -- never "To Whom It May Concern."

3. **Identification of the project.** Name the specific grant program and the applicant organization in the first paragraph. Do not make the reviewer guess which application this letter relates to.

4. **Relationship between the signer and the applicant.** How does the signer know your organization? How long have you worked together? What is the basis for their support?

5. **Specific endorsement of the proposed project.** The letter should reference the actual activities, goals, or approach described in the proposal -- not vague generalities about the importance of the issue.

6. **The signer's role (if any).** If the signer or their organization will contribute to the project, describe the contribution specifically: number of referrals, hours of staff time, access to facilities, matching funds, data sharing, etc.

7. **Contact information.** The signer's title, organization, phone number, and email.

8. **Letterhead.** The letter must be on the signer's official organizational letterhead. Letters without letterhead look informal and raise questions about authenticity.

## Four Templates You Can Adapt

The following templates are starting points. Every letter should be customized to reflect the actual relationship and the specific project. Reviewers can identify boilerplate letters, and they discount them accordingly.

### Template 1: Community Partner Letter of Commitment

This template is for an organization that will play an active role in the proposed project.

## Timing and Logistics

### When to Request Letters

Start requesting letters at least four to six weeks before your submission deadline. This gives your partners time to draft or review the letter, route it through internal approvals (universities and government agencies often require this), and return a signed copy on letterhead.

Build a tracking spreadsheet for each proposal that lists every letter you need, the contact person, the date you sent the request, the follow-up dates, and the date you received the signed letter. Letters are the component most likely to arrive late and jeopardize your submission.

### What to Provide Your Letter Writers

Make it easy for people to write strong letters by providing:

1. **A one-page project summary** including the project name, funder, goals, activities, timeline, and budget.
2. **A description of their role** in the project, if applicable, with specifics on what you are asking them to contribute.
3. **A draft letter** (optional but appreciated). Many partners prefer to start from a draft rather than write from scratch. Make it clear they should modify the draft to reflect their own voice and perspective.
4. **Formatting requirements** -- the funder's name and address for the salutation, any page limits, and the deadline.
5. **Submission instructions** -- whether you need a PDF scan of the signed letter, a hard copy, or an upload to a portal.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Generic letters.** A letter that could be attached to any proposal from any organization is worse than no letter at all. It signals a superficial relationship. Every letter should reference the specific project, the specific funder, and the specific role of the signer.

**Unsigned or undated letters.** Reviewers will question whether the letter is authentic. Always submit signed originals (scanned PDFs are acceptable) with current dates.

**Letters on plain paper.** Official letterhead is required. If your community partner is a grassroots organization without letterhead, help them create simple letterhead before they write the letter.

**Too many letters.** More is not always better. Five strong, specific letters from the right people are more effective than fifteen generic letters from tangentially related organizations. Follow the NOFO's guidance -- if it says "include 3-5 letters of support," do not submit twelve.

**Letters that contradict your proposal.** This happens more often than you would expect. If your proposal says Partner A will provide 100 referrals, but Partner A's letter says they will provide 50, reviewers notice the inconsistency. Share the relevant section of your proposal with each letter writer to ensure alignment.

**Requesting letters from the funder's own staff.** Do not ask employees of the funding agency to write letters of support for your application. This creates a conflict of interest and will harm your application.

## How Reviewers Evaluate Letters of Support

Most reviewers do not read letters of support closely -- unless something stands out, for better or worse. Here is what catches their attention:

**Specificity.** A letter that names the project, describes a concrete contribution, and demonstrates genuine familiarity with the proposed work stands out positively in a stack of generic endorsements.

**Alignment with the narrative.** Reviewers cross-reference letters against the project description and budget. If the narrative claims a partnership with a hospital for clinical referrals, the letter from that hospital should confirm the referral arrangement and provide enough detail to be credible.

**Reputation of the signer.** A letter from a recognized institution, an elected official, or a respected community leader carries more weight than a letter from an unknown individual. This is not always fair, but it reflects how review panels operate.

**Red flags.** Letters that appear to be written by the applicant (identical formatting, voice, and language across multiple letters) raise concerns about authenticity. Letters with factual inconsistencies or vague language suggest the partnership may not be real.

## Special Cases

### Letters for Federal Grants with Cost-Share Requirements

Some federal grants require matching funds, and letters of commitment are one of the primary ways to document in-kind cost share. If you are committing partner contributions as cost share, the letter must explicitly state the dollar value of the contribution and confirm that the partner understands the contribution is subject to federal audit requirements.

For example: "We commit to providing 500 hours of volunteer time (valued at $15.43/hour per the Independent Sector rate, totaling $7,715) for community outreach activities described in the proposal."

### Letters for SBIR/STTR Proposals

SBIR Phase II proposals benefit enormously from letters of intent or commitment from potential customers. These letters serve as commercialization evidence -- proof that someone wants to buy what you are building. The stronger and more specific these letters are, the higher your commercialization score will be.

For STTR proposals, a letter from the partnering research institution is mandatory. It must confirm the collaborative arrangement and the allocation of work between the small business and the research institution.

### Letters for Foundation Grants

Foundation grants typically have less rigid requirements for letters of support, but they still add value. Focus on letters from organizations that know your work firsthand and can speak to your effectiveness. Board member letters are common for foundation proposals but carry less weight than letters from external partners.

Letters of support are one of the few proposal components where the effort required is largely logistical, not intellectual. The challenge is not writing them -- it is planning ahead, making requests early, providing your partners with the information they need, and tracking every letter to ensure nothing falls through the cracks. Treat letters as a project management task, not an afterthought, and they will strengthen every proposal you submit.
