If you work in coastal conservation, habitat restoration, or community resilience planning, 2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for federal grant funding. Despite political headwinds around NOAA's budget, Congress has preserved the vast majority of coastal resilience funding, and several major programs are actively accepting or preparing to accept applications. The question is not whether the money exists. The question is whether your organization is positioned to compete for it.

I have spent the last decade managing coastal restoration projects funded by NOAA, NFWF, and Sea Grant programs. Here is my read on the funding landscape and what it takes to land these awards.

## The Big Picture: Where the Money Is

Several major funding streams are actively supporting coastal resilience work right now.

### Transformational Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience Grants

This is the flagship program for large-scale coastal work. NOAA made $100 million available under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for projects that restore coastal habitat and strengthen community resilience. Individual awards range from $750,000 to $10 million, with typical funding between $4 million and $6 million.

Up to 15 percent of available funds are specifically reserved for federally recognized tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, and organizations that represent tribes. If your organization serves tribal communities, this set-aside significantly improves your competitive position.

### National Coastal Wetlands Conservation Grants (FY 2026)

Administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rather than NOAA, this program funds the protection and restoration of coastal wetland ecosystems. Awards range from $50,000 to $1 million, with a required 25 percent non-federal match.

The FY 2026 application deadline is July 18, 2025. Eligible applicants are limited to state and territory agencies designated by their governor, so if you are a nonprofit or university, you need to partner with your state's natural resource or fish and wildlife agency to access this funding.

Eligible states and territories include those bordering the Great Lakes, Atlantic, Gulf (except Louisiana, which has its own program), and Pacific coasts.

### National Coastal Resilience Fund

The National Coastal Resilience Fund, a partnership between NOAA and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, has invested approximately $144 million in 96 projects to date. These projects help communities prepare for coastal flooding and intensifying storms while restoring thousands of acres of habitat.

The 2025 Request for Proposals cycle provides a template for what to expect in 2026. Watch the NFWF website for updated timelines.

### NOAA Sea Grant Programs

NOAA Sea Grant awarded $15.9 million to support over 300 projects nationally, with universities, states, and partners contributing an additional $7.9 million in matching funds. Each of the 34 Sea Grant programs also received $125,000 specifically for coastal resilience work.

Your regional Sea Grant program is often the best entry point if your organization is new to federal coastal funding. These programs fund smaller projects, provide technical assistance, and can connect you with larger funding opportunities down the line.

## Eligibility Requirements at a Glance

Eligibility varies by program, but here are the common threads:

- **Transformational Habitat Grants**: State, local, and tribal governments, nonprofits, educational institutions, and for-profit entities working in U.S. coastal areas
- **Coastal Wetlands Conservation**: State and territory agencies only (designated by governor), though partnerships with nonprofits and universities are encouraged
- **National Coastal Resilience Fund**: Nonprofits, state and local governments, tribes, and educational institutions
- **Sea Grant**: Varies by state program. Typically universities, nonprofits, and government agencies

All programs require active SAM.gov registration and most require submission through Grants.gov.

## How to Build a Competitive Proposal

Having reviewed and contributed to dozens of funded coastal resilience proposals, here is what consistently separates winners from the rest.

### Lead With Community Resilience Outcomes

NOAA has shifted its framing over the last several funding cycles. Habitat restoration is no longer sufficient on its own. You need to connect your ecological work to measurable community outcomes. How does restoring this salt marsh reduce flood risk to the adjacent neighborhood? How does removing this vessel debris improve navigation safety for the local fishing fleet? What economic benefits does the restored habitat create?

### Build Genuine Partnerships Early

NOAA explicitly prioritizes projects with strong partnerships across federal, state, and local agencies, community organizations, and tribes. These cannot be paper partnerships. Reviewers can tell the difference between a letter of support written the week before the deadline and a letter that reflects months of collaborative planning.

If your project involves work in waters of the United States, conduct a permit pre-application meeting with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers before you submit. This demonstrates operational readiness and helps you identify regulatory hurdles early.

### Address Permitting and Compliance Head-On

One of the most common reasons otherwise strong proposals receive lower scores is vague language around permitting. Successful applicants provide documentation showing that permits are either in hand or that a credible path to permitting exists. Identify every relevant permit (Section 404, Section 10, state coastal zone consistency, ESA consultation) and describe where each stands in the process.

### Make Your Budget Defensible

Reviewers are looking for cost-effectiveness, not just the lowest budget. A $4 million proposal that restores 200 acres of coastal habitat with detailed unit costs, subcontractor bids, and realistic overhead rates will outscore a $2 million proposal with vague line items. Show your work.

### Plan for Long-Term Monitoring

Federal funders increasingly want to see what happens after the grant period ends. Who maintains the restored site? How will you measure ecological recovery over 5, 10, or 20 years? What is your plan for adaptive management if initial restoration targets are not met? A strong monitoring and maintenance plan demonstrates that you are investing in lasting outcomes, not just spending federal dollars.

## The Budget Landscape: What Applicants Should Know

The FY2026 federal budget process created uncertainty across NOAA programs. The initial proposal called for cuts of more than $1.8 billion from NOAA, including 50 percent reductions to the National Ocean Service. However, bipartisan congressional support preserved NOAA funding at approximately $6.1 billion, close to FY2025 levels.

For coastal resilience programs specifically, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funds operate on a separate five-year authorization and are less vulnerable to annual budget negotiations. This makes BIL-funded programs like the Transformational Habitat Grants particularly attractive targets for applicants seeking funding stability.

## Start Now, Not Later

The single most actionable piece of advice I can offer: do not wait for the next Notice of Funding Opportunity to start preparing. The organizations that consistently win coastal resilience grants are the ones doing groundwork year-round. Build your partnerships, document your site conditions, secure preliminary permits, and develop your monitoring plans before the clock starts ticking on an application deadline.
