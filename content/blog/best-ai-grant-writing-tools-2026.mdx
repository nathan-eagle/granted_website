The number of AI tools claiming to help with grant writing has exploded over the past two years. Some are genuinely useful. Some are ChatGPT wrappers with a grant-themed landing page. And some solve real problems but are not the right fit for every applicant.

I have spent the past year testing every major AI tool that touches grant writing -- submitting proposals through purpose-built platforms, using general-purpose AI assistants for drafting, and evaluating discovery tools that help you find funding opportunities. This is what I found.

## Why Grant Writing Is Different from General Writing

Before comparing tools, it is worth understanding why grant writing is a distinct problem that general AI often handles poorly.

A grant proposal is not a persuasive essay. It is a highly structured document with specific sections, mandated by a funder, scored against explicit criteria, and subject to formatting rules that vary by agency. A successful R01 application to NIH requires you to address Significance, Innovation, and Approach in a specific way. A DOD SBIR Phase I proposal must respond to a defined topic with precise technical objectives. An NSF proposal needs both intellectual merit and broader impacts.

The challenge is not generating fluent text. Any large language model can do that. The challenge is generating text that is responsive to a particular solicitation, consistent across sections, technically accurate, properly scoped to page limits, and structured to score well against the review criteria. That distinction separates purpose-built grant writing tools from general AI assistants.

## Purpose-Built Grant Writing Platforms

These are tools designed specifically for the grant proposal workflow. They understand the structure of proposals, the requirements of funders, and the end-to-end process from RFP to submission.

### Granted AI

Granted AI is built around a specific workflow: you upload your RFP or solicitation, and the platform analyzes the document to identify requirements, sections, evaluation criteria, and compliance details. From there, it coaches you through each section of the proposal, asking the questions a grant consultant would ask, and then drafts content based on your answers and the funder's requirements.

**What it does well:**

- RFP analysis is the core differentiator. The platform reads your actual solicitation document and structures the entire proposal around its specific requirements -- not generic templates.
- Section-by-section coaching. Instead of generating an entire proposal in one shot (which inevitably produces inconsistencies), the tool walks you through each section, ensuring your narrative builds coherently.
- Coverage tracking. It monitors whether your draft addresses each requirement identified in the RFP, flagging gaps before you submit.
- Works across agency types. Whether you are writing for NIH, NSF, DOD, USDA, EPA, or private foundations, the tool adapts to the solicitation rather than assuming a fixed format.

**Pricing:** Starts at $49/month with a 7-day free trial. See the full [pricing breakdown](/pricing).

**Limitations:** Granted AI is focused on the writing phase. It does not include grant discovery (finding funding opportunities) or post-award grant management features.

### Grantboost

Grantboost is another AI-powered grant writing tool that targets both nonprofit and research grant writers. The platform offers template-based drafting, where you select a grant type and fill in organizational details, and the AI generates proposal sections.

**What it does well:**

- Clean, straightforward interface that is easy to learn
- Templates for common grant types (federal, foundation, corporate)
- Collaboration features for teams working on a proposal together

**Limitations:**

- The template approach means the tool works best for common, well-known grant types. For unusual solicitations or highly specific RFPs, you may find the templates do not map well to your requirements.
- Less emphasis on analyzing the specific solicitation document. The output tends to be more generic than what you get from a tool that ingests and parses your actual RFP.

For a more detailed comparison, see our [Granted AI vs. Grantboost breakdown](/compare/grantboost).

### Grantable

Grantable positions itself as a grant management and writing platform, combining proposal development with organizational tools like deadline tracking and document storage. It has been in the market longer than most AI-focused tools, having started primarily as a grant management system before adding AI writing features.

**What it does well:**

- Strong organizational features -- deadline calendars, document repositories, and team coordination
- Good for organizations managing multiple active grants simultaneously
- The AI writing assistance has improved steadily and handles common proposal sections competently

**Limitations:**

- The AI writing capabilities were added to an existing management platform rather than being the core product. For users whose primary need is drafting assistance, the grant management features may feel like overhead.
- Pricing is higher than writing-only tools, reflecting the broader feature set.

## General-Purpose AI Assistants

Many grant writers use general AI models -- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others -- as part of their writing process. These tools are powerful, flexible, and often free or low-cost. But using them effectively for grant writing requires significant expertise from the user.

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)

ChatGPT is the most widely used AI assistant, and many grant writers have incorporated it into their workflow.

**Strengths for grant writing:**

- Excellent at generating fluent, well-organized prose
- Custom GPTs allow you to create specialized grant writing assistants with specific instructions
- Can help with brainstorming, outlining, editing, and rewriting
- Good at summarizing research literature for background sections

**Limitations for grant writing:**

- No awareness of your specific solicitation requirements unless you paste them into the conversation, and even then, the model does not systematically track compliance
- Context window limitations mean that long proposals with many interdependent sections can lose coherence
- Generates plausible-sounding but sometimes inaccurate content, especially for budget figures, agency-specific rules, and technical details
- No built-in workflow for moving from RFP analysis to finished proposal

### Claude (Anthropic)

Claude, particularly the latest Opus and Sonnet models, handles long documents well and produces careful, nuanced writing.

**Strengths for grant writing:**

- Large context window is useful for ingesting solicitation documents and previously written sections
- Strong at maintaining consistency across long documents
- Tends to be more precise and less prone to fabrication than some competitors
- Excellent at editing and providing detailed feedback on drafts

**Limitations for grant writing:**

- Same fundamental issue as ChatGPT: it is a general-purpose assistant, not a purpose-built grant workflow tool
- You bear the full burden of structuring the process, tracking requirements, and ensuring compliance
- No persistent memory of your organization, past proposals, or ongoing projects between sessions

### Google Gemini

Google's Gemini models have improved substantially and offer integration with Google Workspace tools that many grant teams already use.

**Strengths for grant writing:**

- Deep integration with Google Docs, Sheets, and Drive
- Strong at research tasks, especially synthesizing information from multiple sources
- Accessible through the free tier for basic use

**Limitations for grant writing:**

- The grant-specific capabilities lag behind both ChatGPT and Claude in terms of writing quality for technical proposals
- Same workflow limitations as other general assistants -- no RFP parsing, no section tracking, no compliance monitoring

### The Bottom Line on General AI

General-purpose AI assistants are useful tools for grant writers who already know what they are doing. If you understand the structure of a proposal, know the review criteria, can identify which RFP requirements map to which sections, and can critically evaluate AI output for accuracy -- then ChatGPT or Claude can save you real time on drafting and editing.

But if you are a less experienced grant writer, or if you are working with a complex solicitation you have not encountered before, a general AI assistant will not guide you through the process. It will generate text, and some of that text will be good, but it will not tell you that your Approach section does not address criterion 3 in the scoring rubric or that your budget justification is missing the fringe benefit calculation the agency requires.

That gap is precisely what purpose-built tools are designed to fill.

## Grant Discovery and Management Platforms

These tools help you find funding opportunities and manage the grant lifecycle. They are not primarily writing tools, but they are part of the ecosystem.

### Instrumentl

Instrumentl is the most popular grant discovery platform for nonprofits and research organizations. It aggregates funding opportunities from federal, state, foundation, and corporate sources, and uses matching algorithms to recommend opportunities based on your organization's profile.

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive database of funding opportunities with good search and filtering
- Deadline tracking and pipeline management
- Funder insights (past award data, giving patterns, 990 analysis for foundations)
- Saved search alerts so you are notified when new matching opportunities appear

**Limitations:**

- Instrumentl is a discovery and management tool, not a writing tool. It does not help you draft proposals.
- Pricing starts around $179/month, which makes it a significant investment for smaller organizations.
- Some users report that the matching algorithm surfaces too many results, requiring manual filtering.

### Grants.gov

Grants.gov is the federal government's free portal for finding and applying for federal grants. Every discretionary federal grant must be posted here.

**Strengths:**

- Free and comprehensive for federal opportunities
- Official source -- every federal grant is listed here
- Integrated application submission for many agencies

**Limitations:**

- No foundation or corporate grants
- The search functionality is basic compared to commercial tools
- No AI-powered matching or recommendations
- The user interface has improved but remains cumbersome

### How Discovery Fits with Writing

Grant discovery and grant writing are complementary but distinct workflows. Instrumentl helps you find the right opportunity; Granted AI helps you respond to it effectively. Some organizations use both -- Instrumentl to build their pipeline and a writing tool to execute on the highest-priority opportunities.

## Traditional Grant Writing Support

For context, it is worth noting what AI tools are replacing or supplementing.

### Professional Grant Writers and Consultants

Hiring a professional grant writer typically costs $75 to $200 per hour, or $3,000 to $15,000 per proposal depending on complexity. For large federal grants, consultants who specialize in specific agencies can charge $20,000 or more.

**When a consultant makes sense:**

- You are applying for a high-value grant ($500K+) where the stakes justify the investment
- The solicitation is in a domain where you lack expertise
- Your organization does not have internal grant writing capacity

**When a consultant may not make sense:**

- You are applying for smaller grants where the consultant fee approaches the award amount
- You need to build internal capacity for recurring applications
- Your timeline is too short to onboard a consultant effectively

For a deeper analysis of when to hire versus when to use software, see our [comparison of Granted AI versus professional grant writers](/compare/grant-writers).

### Doing It Yourself

Many organizations, especially smaller nonprofits and early-stage startups, write proposals themselves without any paid tools or consultants. This is entirely viable, especially for smaller grants or for applicants with prior experience.

The main costs are time and opportunity cost. A first-time federal grant proposal typically takes 80 to 200 hours of staff time. If that time would otherwise generate revenue or advance your mission, the true cost of doing it yourself is higher than it appears.

We break down the full cost analysis in our [comparison of AI tools versus writing proposals yourself](/compare/doing-it-yourself).

## How to Choose the Right Tool

The right tool depends on your situation:

**If you write proposals regularly and need efficiency gains:** A purpose-built platform like Granted AI will save the most time per proposal because it handles the structural and compliance work that general AI cannot.

**If you write one or two proposals per year and are already experienced:** A general-purpose AI assistant (ChatGPT or Claude) combined with careful manual process management may be sufficient.

**If your bottleneck is finding opportunities, not writing:** Start with a discovery tool like Instrumentl. The best-written proposal for the wrong opportunity is still a waste of time.

**If you are a first-time applicant:** You benefit the most from a tool that guides the process, not just generates text. The coaching and RFP analysis features of purpose-built platforms provide structure that general AI does not. [See how Granted supports first-time applicants](/for/first-time) with step-by-step coaching from RFP analysis through submission.

**If you manage a portfolio of grants:** Consider a combination: a discovery tool for pipeline management and a writing tool for proposal development. The workflow integration between finding opportunities and responding to them is where organizations gain the most leverage.

## What Matters Most

Ultimately, no AI tool writes a winning proposal by itself. The technology, the team, the track record, and the fit with the funder's priorities -- those are the things that determine whether you get funded. AI tools make the writing process faster and more systematic, but they do not substitute for a strong underlying project.

The tools that add the most value are the ones that understand the structure of the grant writing process: parsing solicitations, tracking requirements, ensuring consistency across sections, and flagging gaps before you submit. Whether that comes from a purpose-built platform or a disciplined workflow using general AI depends on your team's expertise and volume of proposals.
