Federal environmental funding is spread across more than a dozen agencies, each with its own application processes, eligibility rules, and program cultures. EPA alone administers over 60 distinct grant programs. Add NOAA, the Department of the Interior, USDA conservation programs, and DOE environmental research funding, and the landscape becomes genuinely overwhelming.

This guide is designed as a reference document. It organizes every major federal environmental funding program by purpose -- assessment, cleanup, planning, education, and research -- so you can identify the programs most relevant to your work and understand how they differ. Whether you are a community nonprofit addressing contamination, a university conducting environmental research, a tribal nation managing natural resources, or a local government planning infrastructure improvements, this guide covers the federal funding available to you.

## EPA Grant Programs

### Environmental Justice Programs

EPA's environmental justice portfolio has undergone significant changes. Understanding the current state of these programs is essential for organizations that have historically relied on them.

**Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving (EJCPS):** EJCPS has been EPA's flagship community-level EJ grant program since 2003. Awards have historically ranged from $150,000 to $500,000 for community-based organizations addressing environmental and public health issues in overburdened communities. The program funds collaborative projects that bring together residents, government agencies, and other stakeholders to develop solutions to local environmental problems. As of 2026, EJCPS funding has been significantly affected by federal budget changes. Check EPA's website for current availability.

**Community Change Grants (CCG):** Funded through the Inflation Reduction Act, CCG awarded nearly $1.6 billion to 105 communities for pollution reduction and climate resilience projects. Many awards have been affected by legislative rescissions and administrative actions. Organizations with existing awards should verify their status with their EPA project officer.

**Environmental Justice Government-to-Government (EJG2G):** This program funds state, local, and tribal governments to work on environmental justice issues. Awards have historically ranged from $100,000 to $1 million. Like other EJ programs, its current status is subject to budgetary and policy changes.

### Brownfields Grants

EPA's Brownfields program is one of the most established and consistently funded environmental grant programs. It addresses contaminated properties and supports their assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment.

**Brownfields Assessment Grants:** Up to $500,000 per grant (or $600,000 for community-wide assessments) for Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments. Eligible applicants include states, tribes, local governments, regional councils, land clearance authorities, and nonprofit organizations. These grants fund the investigation of contamination -- not the cleanup itself.

**Brownfields Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) Grants:** Up to $1 million per grant to capitalize a revolving loan fund that provides financing for brownfield cleanup activities. Recipients make loans to borrowers who clean up brownfield sites; repayments are recycled back into the fund for additional cleanups.

**Brownfields Cleanup Grants:** Up to $500,000 per site for direct cleanup of brownfield properties. Applicants must own the property, and the grant covers the actual remediation work. A 20% cost share is required (can be reduced to 0% for hardship).

**Brownfields Multipurpose Grants:** Up to $800,000 for grants that combine assessment and cleanup activities at a specific brownfield site. These are ideal for projects where the scope of contamination is generally known and the applicant wants to move from assessment to cleanup under a single award.

**Brownfields Job Training Grants:** Up to $500,000 to fund environmental job training programs for residents of communities affected by brownfield sites. These grants train workers in hazardous waste management, lead and asbestos abatement, and other environmental remediation skills.

### Water Infrastructure Programs

EPA administers the two largest water infrastructure funding programs in the federal government, both of which flow through state agencies.

**Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF):** The CWSRF provides low-interest loans and, in some cases, principal forgiveness (essentially grants) for wastewater infrastructure, stormwater management, nonpoint source pollution control, and estuary protection projects. EPA capitalizes the fund; states administer it. Annual federal capitalization has ranged from $1.6 billion to over $11 billion (including Bipartisan Infrastructure Law supplemental funding). Contact your state's CWSRF administrator for current terms.

**Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF):** The DWSRF provides financing for drinking water system improvements, including treatment upgrades, distribution system repairs, source water protection, and small system technical assistance. Like the CWSRF, it is administered at the state level. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $11.7 billion in supplemental DWSRF funding specifically for lead service line replacement and emerging contaminant treatment (PFAS, PFOS).

**Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA):** WIFIA provides long-term, low-interest loans for large water infrastructure projects (minimum project cost of $20 million for large systems, $5 million for small systems). Unlike the SRFs, WIFIA is administered directly by EPA.

### Superfund and CERCLA Grants

**CERCLA (Superfund) Site Assessment and Cleanup:** While most Superfund cleanup is conducted directly by EPA or by responsible parties under EPA oversight, several grant and cooperative agreement programs support related activities. These include:

- **Superfund Technical Assistance Grants (TAGs):** Up to $50,000 for community groups at Superfund sites to hire independent technical advisors who can review and interpret site data. TAGs help communities participate meaningfully in cleanup decisions.
- **CERCLA 128(a) State and Tribal Response Programs:** Grants to states and tribes to build and maintain voluntary cleanup programs for contaminated sites that are not on the National Priorities List.

### Air Quality and Emissions Programs

**Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA):** DERA provides grants and rebates to reduce emissions from existing diesel engines. Eligible projects include engine retrofits, replacements, and conversions to cleaner technologies (electric, natural gas, propane). Awards typically range from $200,000 to $2 million. Eligible applicants include states, tribes, local governments, and nonprofit organizations. School bus replacements and port drayage truck electrification have been particularly popular DERA project types.

**Targeted Airshed Grants:** Competitive grants for areas with the most serious air quality challenges. These fund projects that reduce ozone and particulate matter concentrations, including woodstove changeout programs, agricultural burn reduction, and transportation emission reduction projects.

### Regional and Ecosystem Programs

EPA administers several place-based programs that fund environmental protection in specific geographic areas.

**Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI):** Approximately $350-475 million annually for projects that address the most significant environmental problems in the Great Lakes ecosystem. Focus areas include toxic substance cleanup, invasive species control, nonpoint source pollution, habitat restoration, and accountability. Eligible applicants include states, tribes, local governments, universities, and nonprofit organizations. Projects must directly benefit the Great Lakes basin.

**Chesapeake Bay Program:** Grants supporting restoration of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, including nutrient and sediment reduction, habitat restoration, fish passage, and monitoring. Funding flows through multiple mechanisms, including competitive grants and formula-based allocations to the six bay states and the District of Columbia.

**Gulf of Mexico Program:** Grants and technical assistance for projects that protect and restore the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Focus areas include water quality improvement, habitat conservation, environmental education, and community resilience.

**Long Island Sound Study:** Competitive grants for projects that restore and protect Long Island Sound, including habitat restoration, water quality improvement, and public education.

**Lake Champlain Basin Program:** Grants for water quality and habitat projects in the Lake Champlain watershed spanning Vermont, New York, and Quebec.

### Tribal Environmental Programs

EPA provides several grant programs specifically for federally recognized tribal governments.

**Indian Environmental General Assistance Program (GAP):** Formula-based grants to tribes to build capacity for environmental program management. GAP funding supports tribal environmental offices, staff training, and basic environmental program development. Nearly every federally recognized tribe in the lower 48 states and Alaska receives GAP funding.

**Tribal Clean Water Act Section 106:** Grants to tribes to administer water pollution control programs, including water quality monitoring, assessment, and standards development.

**Tribal Drinking Water Program Grants:** Grants to tribes to implement public water system supervision programs on tribal lands.

**EPA Tribal IGAP and Multimedia Grants:** Additional capacity-building grants that help tribes address multiple environmental media (air, water, waste) through integrated approaches.

### Environmental Education Grants

**EPA Environmental Education Grants:** Competitive grants of $50,000 to $100,000 (or up to $200,000 for regional projects) for environmental education projects that increase public awareness and knowledge of environmental issues. Eligible applicants include state and local agencies, tribal governments, universities, and nonprofit organizations. Funded projects have included citizen science programs, teacher training initiatives, and community-based environmental monitoring.

## NOAA Grant Programs

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration funds environmental research, coastal management, fisheries, and ocean conservation through several major programs.

### Coastal Zone Management Grants

**Section 306 and 306A Grants:** Formula-based grants to states with approved Coastal Zone Management Programs. These fund program administration, coastal land acquisition, and construction projects that implement the state's coastal management plan.

**Coastal Resilience Grants:** Competitive grants for projects that strengthen community resilience to coastal hazards including sea level rise, storm surge, flooding, and erosion. Typical awards range from $250,000 to $2 million.

### Sea Grant Programs

**National Sea Grant College Program:** NOAA funds a network of 34 Sea Grant programs at universities across the coastal and Great Lakes states. Each Sea Grant program administers competitive grants for research, extension, and education related to coastal and marine issues. Individual research awards typically range from $50,000 to $250,000 per year.

**Marine Debris Program Grants:** Competitive grants for marine debris assessment, prevention, and removal projects. Awards typically range from $100,000 to $500,000 for removal projects and $50,000 to $150,000 for prevention and education projects.

### Fisheries and Habitat Programs

**Saltonstall-Kennedy (S-K) Grants:** Competitive research grants (typically $100,000 to $400,000) for projects that address the needs of fishing communities, promote sustainable fisheries, and support aquaculture development.

**Community-Based Restoration Program:** Grants for habitat restoration projects that benefit NOAA trust resources, particularly fish habitat in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Projects include dam removal, fish passage restoration, marsh restoration, and oyster reef construction.

**Bycatch Reduction Engineering Program (BREP):** Grants for developing and testing fishing gear modifications that reduce bycatch of non-target species.

## Department of the Interior Programs

### Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) Grants

**State Wildlife Grants (SWG):** Formula-based grants to state wildlife agencies for conservation of species of greatest conservation need. States must have an approved State Wildlife Action Plan to receive funding.

**North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) Grants:** Competitive grants for wetland acquisition, restoration, and enhancement in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Standard grants are $1 million or more; small grants are up to $100,000. A 1:1 non-federal match is required, making partnership development critical.

**Partners for Fish and Wildlife:** Cost-share program that provides technical and financial assistance to private landowners for habitat restoration on their property. FWS biologists work directly with landowners to plan and implement projects.

**Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund:** Grants to states for species recovery, habitat conservation planning, and land acquisition for endangered species.

**Tribal Wildlife Grants:** Competitive grants to tribes for wildlife conservation on tribal lands. Awards typically range from $50,000 to $200,000.

### National Park Service Programs

**Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) State Assistance Program:** Formula-based grants to states for outdoor recreation planning, land acquisition, and facility development. States distribute funds competitively to local governments and state agencies.

**Historic Preservation Fund Grants:** Grants to State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs) and Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs) for survey, planning, and preservation projects.

### Bureau of Reclamation

**WaterSMART Grants:** Competitive grants for water conservation, efficiency, and reuse projects in the western United States. Programs include:

- **Water and Energy Efficiency Grants:** Up to $5 million for projects that improve water delivery systems, reduce water use, or increase energy efficiency in water management
- **Small-Scale Water Efficiency Projects:** Up to $75,000 for smaller efficiency improvements
- **Drought Response and Planning Grants:** Funding for drought contingency planning and response actions

## USDA Conservation Programs

USDA administers some of the largest conservation funding programs in the federal government through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

### NRCS Programs

**Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP):** The largest NRCS conservation program, providing financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers and forest landowners for conservation practices. Annual funding exceeds $2 billion. EQIP covers practices including cover cropping, nutrient management, irrigation efficiency, forest stand improvement, and wildlife habitat enhancement. Payments are based on practice-specific cost estimates and can cover up to 75% of practice costs (higher for historically underserved producers).

**Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP):** Payments to producers who maintain existing conservation practices and adopt additional ones. CSP is the largest acreage-based conservation program in the country. Unlike EQIP, which funds specific practice installations, CSP provides annual per-acre payments for comprehensive stewardship of working lands.

**Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP):** Competitive grants to conservation partners (states, tribes, nonprofits, water districts, and agricultural organizations) to design and implement conservation projects in priority areas. RCPP leverages partner contributions to maximize the impact of NRCS funding. Individual projects typically receive $1 million to $10 million in NRCS funding, matched by partner contributions.

**Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP):** Provides financial assistance for the purchase of conservation easements on agricultural land (to prevent conversion to non-agricultural use) and wetland easements (to restore and protect wetland functions). ACEP replaces the former Wetlands Reserve Program and Farmland Protection Program.

### FSA Programs

**Conservation Reserve Program (CRP):** Pays agricultural producers annual rental payments to remove environmentally sensitive land from production and establish conservation practices (grassland, trees, wetlands) for 10-15 year contracts. CRP enrollment has historically ranged from 20 to 35 million acres nationwide.

**Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP):** A partnership between USDA and states that targets specific conservation priorities within the CRP framework. CREP projects address water quality, soil erosion, and wildlife habitat in targeted watersheds.

## Practical Advice for Environmental Grant Seekers

### Start with Your State Office

For most EPA programs, the regional EPA office is your first point of contact. EPA has ten regional offices, and each has staff dedicated to specific programs. Regional staff can tell you which programs are currently accepting applications, what the competitive landscape looks like in your area, and whether your project concept aligns with program priorities.

For USDA conservation programs, contact your local NRCS office. NRCS staff provide free technical assistance and can help you design conservation practices that qualify for EQIP, CSP, or ACEP funding.

### Match Your Project to the Right Program

One of the most common mistakes in environmental grant writing is applying to a program that does not quite fit your project. An organization proposing a habitat restoration project would be better served by NAWCA or NOAA Community-Based Restoration than by an EPA Brownfields grant, even if the site happens to have some contamination.

Read the program description carefully and verify that:

- Your organization type is eligible
- Your project type is eligible
- Your geographic area is eligible
- The funding amount is appropriate for your project scale

### Build Partnerships Before You Apply

Many environmental grant programs explicitly score partnerships and collaboration. Building relationships with partner organizations before the application deadline -- and securing letters of commitment, MOUs, or subcontract agreements -- is essential for a competitive application.

Key partnership categories for environmental grants:

- **Government agencies** (state environmental agencies, local health departments, tribal environmental offices)
- **Academic institutions** (universities with relevant research programs)
- **Community organizations** (neighborhood groups, environmental justice organizations, civic associations)
- **Technical consultants** (environmental engineers, ecologists, remediation firms)
- **Land trusts and conservation organizations** (for land acquisition and easement projects)

### Track Multiple Funding Cycles

Environmental grant programs operate on different schedules. Some are annual competitions with fixed deadlines. Others accept applications on a rolling basis. And some, like the SRFs, have state-specific timelines that vary from one jurisdiction to another.

Maintain a calendar of relevant program deadlines and start preparing applications at least 3-4 months before the deadline. For programs you have not applied to before, budget extra time for understanding the application requirements and assembling the required documentation.

### Use Technology to Manage Complex Applications

Federal environmental grant applications are often long and detailed, with specific requirements for each section, supporting documentation, and compliance certifications. Tools like [Granted AI](/features) can help you analyze the solicitation, track requirements across sections, and draft proposal content that addresses the funder's scoring criteria systematically. This is particularly valuable for programs like EPA Brownfields and NOAA Coastal Resilience, where NOFOs run 40 or more pages and include detailed scoring rubrics.
